## Documentation

You can read the Power+ docs at [powerplus.app/docs](https://powerplus.app/docs). 

## Code Organization

- `/scripts` Power+ script files
- `/scripts/lms` LMS integration files
- `/www` Static website files
- `/docs` JSDoc configuration
- `/chrome` Chrome extension source
- `/build` Public website and optimized JavaScript files generated by `npm run build`

## Development Environment

To get Power+ up and running locally, you'll need git and node installed on your system.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jottocraft/dtps.git dtps
cd dtps
npm install
npm start
```

When the server is ready, open Power+ and go to Settings -> About -> Show Advanced Options -> Test prerelease versions. Then, reload Power+ and go to Settings -> Prerelease testing and select "Local". This will make Power+ load from the local server instead of the live version the next time you reload.

## NPM scripts
- `start` Starts an HTTP server for testing Power+ locally
- `build` Minifies Power+ and generates docs into the build folder for deployment
- `deploy` Runs the build script, then deploys Power+ to the gh-pages branch for hosting
