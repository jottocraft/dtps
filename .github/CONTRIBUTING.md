## Contributing to Power+
Power+ is open-source and open to contributions on GitHub. Making PRs will make you a contributor on GitHub (the contributor badge on Power+ is invite-only). This document will provide several important details on how Power+ is developed and additional information about debugging Power+.

### Pull request guidelines
General pull request guidelines:
* All PRs must be made in dev.js and dev.css. PRs made to the stable Power+ files will not be accepted.
* PRs cannot give, take change, add, or remove Power+ badges
* Never change any version info or change any changelogs in a PR
* PRs should generally include only small bugfixes and minor changes. PRs that make major changes will not be accepted. If you want to add a feature in a PR, you can commit the code that is needed for fetching data needed for your feature, then make a feature request on GitHub issues.
* Any PRs that attempt to steal user data or include any bad stuff like malware, bloatware, etc. will cause the PR to be instantly denied and the user will get banned from contributing to Power+.

### Release schedule
A new major stable release of Power+ typically occurs at the beginning of every month. To use the very latest code, make sure you are using the dev version of Power+. Version numbers and features included in the dev channel are pretty much meaningless; the build number matters much more. Minor releases (0.0.x) are rare and only occur if major bugfixs needs to be pushed to stable ASAP. Fixes don't always indicate a new release number. Releases both have a version number and a month (v1.5.0 can also be called the Febuary 2019 update)
