### Experimental features
* Features marked with a experiment icon are incomplete. Do not submit issues related to any of these features. These features should only appear if you are a Project DTPS tester or if you are on a pre-release version of Project DTPS.

### Contributing (PRs and code)
* Do not submit PRs to add/edit/remove any profile badges. Profile badges should only be created and distributed by jottocraft.
* Only submit PRs that edit dev.js. Never edit/make a PR for init.js. init.js will be updated to match dev.js for the next release. Use the [dev bookmark](https://dtps.js.org/devbookmark.txt) to use dev.js to access the new features early.
* Never change build numbers, version numbers, changelogs, or releases. Releases, changelogs, version numbers, etc. are all determined by jottocraft.
* Never change any core components Project DTPS (never change name, attempt a redesign, new icon, major reworks, etc.)
* If you feel like your PR needs an exception for one of these guidelines or you are unsure about any of these, submit the PR anyways.
