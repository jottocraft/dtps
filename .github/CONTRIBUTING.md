### Experimental features
* Features marked with a experiment icon are incomplete. Do not submit issues related to any of these features. These features should only appear if you are a Project DTPS tester or if you are on a pre-release version of Project DTPS.

### Contributing (PRs and code)
* Do not submit PRs to add/edit/remove any profile badges. Profile badges should only be created and distributed by the owner.
* Changes submitted via PRs should be small. Don't make any major changes / add any new features with a PR (Just because it makes it hard for me to manage and find things when others make major changes)
