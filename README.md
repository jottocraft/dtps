### Pre-Release To-Do List
Just because something is checked off on this list does not mean it is fully released. Checked off items are items that are present (even if only for devs) and basically finished. Checked off items do not mean that the corresponding release has been released.

*Beta 1 - 1.2*

* ~~Dark mode UI toggle~~
* ~~Feedback and user name somewhere~~
* ~~About menu~~
* ~~Class colors~~
* ~~Master/all classes stream~~
* ~~Speed improvements~~

*Beta 2 - 2.2 11/1*

* ~~Fix animations (gradient)~~
* ~~Multi-block pages~~
* ~~block titles~~
* ~~Pages speed improvements~~
* ~~show assignment weight category in stream~~

*Beta 3 11/1 (early release)*

* ~~dtps.masterStream speed improvements and fix stream bug (almost ready)~~
* ~~Pull Changelogs from GitHub and use Fluid for changelogs~~
* ~~Gradebook tab~~
* ~~Figure out why PowerSchool keeps clearing DTPS cookies and fix it :( (maybe use local storage?)~~

*v0.9.x Late 11/2 or Early 11/3 - Late 11/4 or Early 11/5*
* GMs (Release candidates)
* each .x revision contains bugfixes and polishes. no new features in any GM release.
* each v0.9.x version is basically what the release will look like (versions ready to be released). there should only be like 2 of these (1 is ideal, but it probably won't happen because of how the gradebook is right now)

### Post-release To-Do List (unordered)
* About page improvements
* Google Classroom integration (in classroom tab)
* Google Classroom integration (associate GC assignemnts with PS assignments in stream)
* P/DV grading for PE (still show percentage on hover)
* Show letter grades on assignments (settings)
* Grade trend (with localstorage)
