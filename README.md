#### Power+ Roadmap
Here's how Power+ will be changing in the coming months (Updated 4/21/2019):
* ~~April 10th, 2019: Power+ for Canvas can be tested by anyone ([install instructions](https://dtps.js.org/canvas))~~
* ~~Late April / Early May 2019: The final version of Power+ for PowerSchool will be released (The May 2019 update). The dev channel will no longer be active, and will redirect users to Power+ for PowerSchool stable.~~
* June 2019: Power+ for PowerSchool will no longer recive bugfix updates
* July 2019: Power+ for PowerSchool will be archived and will officially become no longer supported. Power+ for Canvas will officially become Power+ and will be hosted on the main Power+ repository as Power+ beta on init.js. At this point, Power+ for Canvas will become the version of Power+ and will be enabled by default for everyone.
* Fall 2019: Power+ for Canvas will be released as a standalone website (the script will be updated to notify users of the change). Power+ development will continue as usual with stable and dev channels. This will take a longer testing time in beta since d.tech admin need to add Power+ as an app on Canvas for it to work. This is currently being tested internally and will hopefully not be in beta for very long.
